    <h1>Speedrun Data from the Legend of Zelda</h1>
    <p>Speed-running is the action of playing a video game, with the goal of beating a set of objectives using the least amount of time possible. Speed-running has become extremely popular, with most games even having a defined set of rules and limitations agreed upon by the gaming community.<br><br>The most recent Zelda games, that is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, also have their own speed-running fanbases. However, achieving a decent speed-run requires not only a good understanding of the game, but also a high-level of skill and knowledge of exploits and glitches.</p>
